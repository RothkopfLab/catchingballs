# Catching balls
A virtual reality environment for a ball catching experiment.

Abstract:
The question how humans run to intercept balls has been addressed in a multitude of studies. There are two conflicting
views on this topic. Proponents of a model-based view argue that humans employ an internal model of the environment,
which they use to predict the trajectory of the ball and plan actions in an optimal way according to these predictions. By
contrast, most of the work on catching balls has relied on different reactive heuristics as an explanation, which establish a
direct relationship between robust optical variables and behavior. For example, the constant bearing angle (CBA) theory
states that humans null the rate of change of the targetâ€™s horizontal angle w.r.t. an allocentric reference direction. We
tested in a within-subjects study (n = 14) whether humans can learn to deviate from the CBA strategy when catching
balls that move at a constant velocity. The contrast of the balls was varied over time in two different ways, such that they
were hard to see when subjects walked according to the CBA strategy. Our results do not indicate that humans deviate
from CBA under these conditions. However, the fact that subjects managed to catch the balls when continuous vision of
the ball trajectory was not available offers some insights about the role of prediction in catching balls. Based on this, we
suggest that additional research is needed to investigate how actions are guided when visual information is lacking.
